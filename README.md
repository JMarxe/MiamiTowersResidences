<h1>Introduction</h1>

This project is considered a medium to low-risk project. This is due to the project risk comparison of multiple projects profitability to succeed. In addition, it was hard to assign a risk matrix to the project because of its unique nature. The risk matrix we implemented was based on the identity of a potential risk and to see if the risk was material enough to classify it as such. Moreover, we put the risk in a category of low, medium, high, and Unknown. Furthermore, impact level of low, medium, high, and unknown.

A Risk management plan and analysis was conducted before the project selection phase. The risk assessment was assigned to the team's Budget and Risk Managers Eltong and Eric. Every aspect of the project down to the last detail was taken into consideration such as, but not limited to.

- Cost of Material
- Team effectiveness
- Resource
- Timeline
- Administrative
- Financing
- Stakeholders
- Governmental Permits
- Budget and Revenue

<h1>Top Three Risks</h1>

The top three high probability and high impact risks to this project are:

1. **Supply Risk**

As we all know Covid-19 has impacted all our lives in many ways, and because of this it has also affected companies manufacturing process. This may cause issues with the expected delivery dates for the supplies to work on this project. The project manager will have to stay in constant communication with these companies to make sure these supplies arrive on time.

2. **LED lights lifespan**

The benefit of the lighting system we have gone with means the lights themselves will last much longer. Yet, that does not mean LED lights are perfect. LED lights are more efficient than halogen lights, but if the heat generated from the lights is trapped in the bulb, then the components inside can fail much quicker than intended. If there is not sufficient ventilation around the LED lights this can cause them to fail prematurely. The project manager will have to make sure the lights are placed in well ventilated areas to ensure they do not fail before they are supposed to.

3. **Weather Risks**

One major concern of ours is the weather here in Miami. It can be very unpredictable and hard to work around. From one minute to the next we can go from harsh storms to a beautiful sunny day. This makes working on electrical lighting fixtures very difficult as well as installing the solar panel on the roof of the building. To lower this risk of any damage to our supplies the project manager will have to keep up with weather forecasts daily.

<h1>Risk Management Approach</h1>

This section provides a general description for the approach taken to identify and manage the risks associated with the project. It should be a short paragraph or two summarizing the approach to risk management on this project.

The first step we have taken to mitigate these project risks is by evaluating the top risks this project can have. We have added these risks to a list and communicated them to our risk managers. The risk managers will take this information and make the necessary adjustments needed when the time comes during the project schedule. They will also stay in communication with the rest of the team and give status reports on our team meetings we added to the project schedule. Towards the end of the project the project manager will analyze how the risks impacted the project and how the risk managers performed under pressure to ensure the project would be completed on the scheduled date. Also, the project manager will discuss any type of improvements that could be made for other future projects.

<h1>Risk Identification</h1>

This section explains the process by which the risks associated with this project were identified. It should describe the method(s) for how the project team identified risks, the format in which Risk Management Plan Template

Risks are recorded, and the forum in which this process was conducted. Typical methods of identifying risks are expert interview, review historical information from similar projects and conducting a risk assessment meeting with the project team and key stakeholders.

For this project, risk identification was conducted in the initial project risk assessment meeting. The method used by the project team to identify risks was the Crawford Slip method. The project manager chaired the risk assessment meeting and distributed notepads to each member of the team and allowed 10 minutes for all team members to record as many risks as possible.

**Expert Interview**

Two Expert Interviews were held for this project. The interviews revealed several risks which were then mitigated by making changes to the project plan. The remaining risks are included in the Risk Register.

**Risk Assessment Meeting**

A risk assessment meeting was held with key team members and stakeholders. The risks identified during this meeting were added to the project plan and Risk Register.

**Historical Review of Similar Projects**

The project team reviewed the history of similar projects to determine the most common risks and the strategies used to mitigate those risks.

<h1>Risk Qualification and Prioritization</h1>

_Qualification:_ During the proposal of the project, the team conducted many risk analyses for the project. To include the risk to do the project renovation. However, in the project charter we identified the main risks. In addition, other risks were identified during the project planning process. To call it a risk, we did a qualification test. The test consisted of the most important aspect of the project, which is "Time". If we can solve a problem in a business day, it wouldn't qualify it as a risk. Any problem that took more than a day, would qualify as a risk.

_Prioritization:_ During the risk management planning. We developed a way to prioritize our risk. To know what to prioritize, we did several risk assessments to identify the impact of the risk on our project, budget, and timeline. In addition, it is a category of internal or external risk. If the risk had all those criteria by an external risk, it would be considered a high risk. And medium risk for internal. External factors and things that are out of our control bare a higher risk. See Risk register.

**Priority ranking for risk and impact level.**

1. Unknown
2. High
3. Medium
4. Low

<h1>Risk Monitoring</h1>

Previously we have discussed the risks that could greatly impact our project. We have also assigned these risks to our risk managers to handle these risks as they come. When we have our project team meetings these risk managers will provide the team with status updates on the risks they have been assigned. Some of our risks such as the weather will be discussed at every project meeting since it is something that is unpredictable. The risk manager will have to keep the entire team updated to ensure the safety of our workers, and to ensure that no of the supplies will be damaged by weather conditions. The risk managers will monitor their assigned risks throughout the entirety of the project. As the project continues to develop the project manager and the risk manager will have top be in constant communication in order to best avoid or mitigate the impact of these risks.

<h1>Risk Mitigation and Avoidance</h1>

1. _Supplier's risk:_ The reason for this procedure is because of any risk our suppliers have or can have. Will have an impact on their ability to deliver to us. Those risks include financial risk, economic risk, and political conditions that can potentially hurt their ability to serve us.

2. _Review Risk Periodically:_ The purpose of this procedure is to make sure that all risks are being monitored on a weekly basis. In addition, this will allow us to identify any threats to the supply chain, financing, and scheduling issues. Also, it can help us prepare in advance if we see a certain risk increasing.

3. _Diverse Suppliers:_ Having more than one supplier will reduce or even more so avoid supply risk altogether. For this reason, we have established other suppliers in different locations and have a pre contract agreement in place to speed up the process.

4. _Uncertainty Risk:_ Due to the nature of the project, the contingency plan to avoid uncertainty risk is to finish the project earlier. If we can have the project work done faster, or some elements of it. This may avoid uncertainty risk.

5. _Schedule Risk Analysis:_ SRA is an effective technique that will help us mitigate the risk of scheduling. SRA can help us with our activity time with better precision. Finishing the project on time priority and for that reason we conducted a Schedule risk analysis.

**RISK REGISTER**

All listed risks for this project & for the project management team to use to solve problems. This important tool analyzes risks in big projects & reduces mitigation or avoidance of risk.

The Risk Register will be maintained as an appendix to this Risk Management Plan.
